# Trusted Internet Connections

## Purpose
The purpose of the Trusted Internet Connections (TIC) initiative, as outlined in the [Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Memorandum M-19-26: Update to the Trusted Internet Connections (TIC) Initiative](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/M-19-26.pdf), is to enhance network and perimeter security across the Federal Government. Initially, this was done through the consolidation of external connections and the deployment of common tools at these access points. While this prior work has been invaluable in securing federal networks and information, the program must adapt to modern architectures and frameworks for government information technology (IT) resource utilization. Accordingly, OMB’s memorandum provides an enhanced approach for implementing the TIC initiative that provides agencies with increased flexibility to use modern security capabilities. OMB’s memorandum also establishes a process for ensuring the TIC initiative is agile and responsive to advancements in technology and rapidly evolving threats.

## Request for Comments
[OMB Memorandum M-19-26](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/M-19-26.pdf) tasks the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) with modernizing the TIC initiative to help accelerate the adoption of cloud, mobile, and other emerging technologies. To further this effort, [CISA is releasing draft guidance](https://www.cisa.gov/trusted-internet-connections) to assist federal civilian agencies in their transition to contemporary architectures and services.

The updated draft TIC guidance provides agencies with the flexibility to secure distinctive computing scenarios in accordance with their unique risk tolerance levels. Agencies are expected to reference the initiative’s Program Guidebook, Reference Architecture, and Security Capabilities Handbook to determine how to protect their environments to conform with their risk management strategy and the security considerations outlined in TIC Use Cases.

Note: Historical TIC program documentation has been archived to the TIC page on [OMB MAX](https://community.max.gov/x/I4R_Ew).

## Guidance Documents
The following draft TIC guidance documents are sequential in nature and should be read in the following order to gain a complete understanding of the modernized initiative: 

1. **Program Guidebook (Volume 1) –** Outlines the modernized TIC program and includes its historical context
2. **Reference Architecture (Volume 2) –** Defines the concepts of the program to guide and constrain the diverse implementations of the security capabilities
3. **Security Capabilities Handbook (Volume 3) –** Indexes security capabilities relevant to TIC
4. **Use Case Handbook (Volume 4) –** Introduces use cases, which describe an implementation of TIC for each identified use
   * **Traditional TIC Use Case –** Describes the architecture and security capabilities guidance for the conventional TIC implementation
   * **Branch Office Use Case –** Describes the architecture and security capabilities guidance for remote offices
5. **Service Provider Overlay Handbook (Volume 5) –** Introduces overlays, which map the security functions of a service provider to the TIC capabilities
   * Overlays are under development and will be released at a later date
      
The use cases, overlays, and security capabilities are going to continue to be developed, including those listed in [OMB Memorandum M-19-26](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/M-19-26.pdf). CISA expects to post updates to the Security Capabilities Handbook, and additional TIC Use Cases, to the [CISA website](https://www.cisa.gov/trusted-internet-connections) as they become available. CISA is coordinating with the Federal Chief Information Security Officers Council TIC Subcommittee to develop use cases above and beyond those listed in the memoranda, including use cases for zero trust, partner networks, and other pertinent scenarios. The TIC PMO is collaborating with cloud and other service providers to develop the overlays. Agencies should refer to the [Service Provider Overlay Repository](https://github.com/cisagov/tic3.0/blob/SPOverlay/README.md) on GitHub to retrieve overlays produced by third-party service providers. 

The TIC Use Cases posted to this site are not an exhaustive representation of all the scenarios agencies may wish to consider when securing their environments. Agencies are encouraged to combine uses cases, as appropriate, to suit their needs.
