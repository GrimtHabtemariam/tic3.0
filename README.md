# Service Provider Overlays

## Purpose
Service Provider Overlays map the TIC 3.0 security capabilities to functionality and capabilities within a service providerâ€™s platform or tool. This approach will allow capabilities to evolve with the need to update use cases independent of the overlays. Overlays will be reviewed and updated to keep pace with service provider offerings.

CISA is actively working with service providers to develop overlays.
