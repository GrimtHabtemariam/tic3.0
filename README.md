# Trusted Internet Connections

## Purpose
The purpose of the Trusted Internet Connections (TIC) initiative, as outlined in the Office of Management and Budget’s (OMB) Memorandum M-19-26, is to enhance network and perimeter security across the Federal Government. Initially, this was done through the consolidation of external connections and the deployment of common tools at these access points. While this prior work has been invaluable in securing Federal networks and information, the program must adapt to modern architectures and frameworks for government information technology (IT) resource utilization. Accordingly, OMB’s memorandum provides an enhanced approach for implementing the TIC initiative that provides agencies with increased flexibility to use modern security capabilities OMB’s memorandum also establishes a process for ensuring the TIC initiative is agile and responsive to advancements in technology and rapidly evolving threats.

## Request for Comments
OMB Memo M-19-26 tasks the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) with modernizing the Trusted Internet Connections (TIC) initiative to help accelerate the adoption of cloud, mobile, and other emerging technologies. To further this effort, CISA is releasing draft guidance to assist Federal civilian agencies in their transition to contemporary architectures and services.

The updated draft TIC guidance provides agencies with the flexibility to secure distinctive computing scenarios in accordance with their unique risk tolerance levels. Agencies are expected to reference the initiative's Program Guidebook, Security Capabilities Handbook, and Reference Architecture to determine how to protect their environments to conform with their risk management strategy and the security considerations outlined in TIC Use Cases.

Note: Historical TIC program documentation has been archived to the TIC page on OMB MAX.
